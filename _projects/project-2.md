- Worked with data of 106 protein-ligand crystal structures of Human Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV by curating from Protein Data Bank and
studying their bonding structure and active residue sites.
- Studied protein-small molecule interactions of DPP-4 aimed at identifying potential inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
