Protein molecules are a good target for the inhibition or promotion of biological processes.
Different methods like QSAR and molecular docking have been developed to accurately
design small binder molecules for target proteins. An alternative model has been developed
wherein a statistical method is used to find the propensity of different non-covalent
interactions between small molecules and amino acid residues of the protein. The results
give hints as to the choice of substituents required at the SM to strongly bind to a
protein.The statistical approach was to study various molecules of DPP4 bounded covalently or non-
covalently with small molecules and through that, document the various functional groups
present and the type of interactions shown in the active site with other ligands. By
approaching via this method, it could be determined the amino acid residues partaking
often to form bonds and gather what type of interactions occurred the most with the small
molecules. Then with the data gathered, we could design a molecule that binds strongly
with DPP4 with the effective binding interactions found. In order to identify efficacious
molecules for inhibiting DPP-4, a quantitative analysis was conducted on 109 X-ray crystal
structures of the DPP-4 protein that contained either covalently or non-covalently bound
small molecules (SMs). The current investigation elucidates both ordinary and perceptive
facets pertaining to protein inhibition.
