@Centre for Brain and Cognition, Computational Neuroscience Group, 
Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain (_Nov 2024 - June 2025_)

**Supervised by - Prof. Gustavo Deco and Dr. Jakub Vohryzek**
- Applied Hopf bifurcation models and gradient algorithms to derive Generative Effective Connectivity (GEC) from ADNI data.
- Identified novel biomarkers for early disease stages potentially enabling better diagnosis and monitoring.
