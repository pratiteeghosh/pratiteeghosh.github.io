I'm a graduate student in Neuroscience at Universitat de Barcelona, specializing in computational neuroscience and whole-brain modeling. My research focuses on understanding neurological disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease, through advanced computational methodologies and neuroimaging analysis.

Research Interests
======
My work centers on applying computational approaches to uncover hidden patterns in brain neural data. Currently, I'm conducting my Master's thesis on whole-brain modeling and dynamical analysis in Alzheimer's disease under the supervision of Prof. Gustavo Deco and Dr. Jakub Vohryzek at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona.

Key research areas include:
- **Whole-brain modeling** using Hopf bifurcation models and gradient algorithms
- **Neuroimaging analysis** with fMRI and connectivity studies
- **Biomarker identification** for early disease detection
- **Computational neuroscience** applications in neurological disorders

Academic Background
======
I hold a B.Sc. (Honors) in Chemistry from the University of Calcutta (2020-2024) and am currently pursuing my Master's in Neuroscience at Universitat de Barcelona (2024-2025). This interdisciplinary background provides me with a unique perspective combining molecular understanding with computational neuroscience approaches.

Technical Expertise
======
**Programming Languages:**
`Python` `MATLAB` `JAVA` `Fortran`

**Neuroimaging Software:**
`SPM` `FSL` `DTIstudio`

**Other Tools:**
`Excel` `Discovery Studio` `Unity`

My research has involved working with large-scale datasets including the Human Connectome Project and ADNI data.


Recent Work
======
My current research involves developing Generative Effective Connectivity (GEC) matrices from neuroimaging data and identifying novel network biomarkers for early Alzheimer's disease stages. Previous projects have included investigating BOLD activation patterns, functional connectivity analysis, and drug design for diabetes treatment.
