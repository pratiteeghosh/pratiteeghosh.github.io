Graduate student in Neuroscience at Universitat de Barcelona, specializing in computational neuroscience and whole-brain modeling, with a focus on Alzheimer’s disease and neuroimaging-driven biomarkers. Passionate about translating dynamical systems and network models into actionable clinical insights. ✨

Research Interests
======
Currently conducting a Master’s thesis on whole-brain modeling and dynamical analysis in Alzheimer’s disease under Prof. Gustavo Deco and Dr. Jakub Vohryzek (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona). The work integrates biophysically informed models with empirical fMRI to probe circuit-level mechanisms. 🧠

Key areas:

- Whole-brain modeling using Hopf bifurcation models and gradient-based optimization for parameter inference
- Neuroimaging analysis (fMRI, structural/functional connectivity) and model-based biomarkers
- Early-stage biomarker identification and network vulnerability profiling
- Computational neuroscience for mechanistic understanding of neurological disorders

Academic Background
======
B.Sc. (Honors) in Chemistry, University of Calcutta (2020–2024). Currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Neuroscience, Universitat de Barcelona (2024–2025). This interdisciplinary path couples molecular-scale intuition with systems-level, model-based neuroscience.
